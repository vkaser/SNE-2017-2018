The Secure Systems and Network Engineering is a one year master program which was originally brought to Innopolis University from University of Amsterdam (SNE at UvA). The program itself is very extensive, and students will have to devote their time fully to the study process.

Typically students have lectures during the first half of the day, and practical assignments and labs afternoon.
